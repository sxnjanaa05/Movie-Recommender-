# Movie-Recommender
In today's digital age, users are overwhelmed with a vast number of movies available across various platforms. A Movie Recommender System helps users discover movies that match their tastes by analyzing their preferences and suggesting relevant content. This project aims to build a simple yet effective Movie Recommender System using Python and data stored in a CSV file.

The system reads movie data from a .csv file containing essential details like movie titles, genres, and ratings. Based on this dataset, the system can recommend movies using techniques such as content-based filtering, which analyzes the features of movies to find similar ones, or collaborative filtering, which suggests movies based on user preferences.
